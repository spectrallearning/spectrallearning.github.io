    <h1>Call for papers</h1>

    <p>
    We invite submissions of papers related to method of moments / spectral
    methods in machine learning.  We strongly support a broad definition of
    spectral learning as any method for learning or fitting a model based on a
    spectral decomposition of observable data.
    </p>

    <p>
    Extended abstracts should be submitted using the ICML 2014 format with a maximum of 4 pages (not including references). Please e-mail your submission to <a href="mailto:workshop.spectral.learning@gmail.com">workshop.spectral.learning@gmail.com</a> with the subject line "Submission to Workshop on Method of Moments and Spectral Learning".
    </p>

    <p>
    Concurrent submissions to the workshop and the main conference (or other
    conferences) are most welcome.
